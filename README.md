# Victory Garden:
To start running Victory Garden, clone the git repo, navigate your cloned repo in Terminal, and run `rails server`

Now, you should be able to login, add leaves, pull from the Nutritionix API, etc. 
A short demo gif, detailing login and different features:

# Technologies : 
In this project, I used :

for Frontend:
1. Bootstrap
   - I customized Bootstrap heavily. 
2. Font Awesome for Rails
3. Jquery for Rails. 

for Password Encryption:
1. BCrypt Gem. 

Database:
1. SQLite 3
    - for some reason this wasn't set up for me on Windows so make sure to verify installation and that it's on PATH. 

TODO: 
1. finish writing documentation :)
2. work on constructing a ruby virtual environment, to avoid conflicts with OS and Ruby versions.
